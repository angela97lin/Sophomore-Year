Angela LinIntroCS2 pd. 6HW#12013-01-30-1. My mother and I share an iMac, I own my personal laptop, and my brother owns a desktop (which he built specifically for gaming). 0. My mother pays for Time Warner Cable monthly. My bandwidth is approximately 20-25 Mbps. 1. The most interesting topic I learned in term one of CS was learning how to implement mathematical sequences and concepts into Scheme. This required learning about the sequence itself and how it worked, then incorporating these ideas into Scheme. 2. The most challenging topic in term one of CS was building models in Netlogo. For me, Netlogo was challenging primarily because Netlogo's syntax was hard to remember and involved a lot of experimentation. As my previous CS teacher had taught, it was important to write a little bit of code, then test it out before continuing in case the code did not work out as expected. This made Netlogo one of the more challenging topics of term one. 3. My primary OS is Mac OS X Version 10.6.8.4. Before attending Stuyvesant, my knowledge of computers and its components was very limited. In fact, I had practically no idea how computers worked--I just used them. I am fascinated as to how a bunch of seemingly random parts could be placed together to form a machine as intelligent as a computer is. In addition, when I find a website or application with cool effects, I always ponder how those effects were implemented.5. "Burning" question: How close am I to becoming a professional game developer or web designer?
