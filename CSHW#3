HTML Resources on the Web

Source #1
Name: "Introduction to HTML"
URL: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp
When I first began my search for online resources, I wanted to learn the very basics of HTML coding. Thus, I searched for exactly that and found this wonderful website. 
I found that this site was a good place to begin exploring HTML because it starts off with the simple basics of HTML coding,explaining also what HTML is and other misc. information. What I really liked about this website is the trial site attached where one could type in HTML coding and instanteously see what the coding did.

Name: Basic Images
URL: http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/basicimages.html
After learning a little a bit about inserting text, I questioned how to insert animations and pictures onto a website, and searched for exactly that. I then came across this website which was somewhat indepth and yet, simple enough for me to understand. 
This website is very useful in which it shows not only how to insert images onto a html code, but also, how to align the image, with step-by-step images, which I found very useful.

Name: "HTML Color Codes"
URL: http://html-color-codes.info/
After adding both an image and text, I wanted to spice up my html code by adding some color, so I decided to research how to change font color and background color! 
I liked the simplicity of this website; It only briefly (but concisely) explained how to insert the code into the html code, and also included a large selection of colors with their color codes, so it was fun to play with!
